Alogrithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. 

+ In place sorting algorithm:
	1. An in place algorithm doesn't need extra memory: Quicksort.
	2. An algorith not in place will need extra memory: Mergesort.

+ Stable Algorithms:
	1. The items with the same value keep the same relative order.
	    Example:
	    	3 -4 10 5* 8 5** 16
	    	-4 3 5* 5** 8 10 16 ---> both 5's kept the same relative order: it's an stable algorithm.
	Merge sort is stable.
	Quick sort is not.


+ Comparison based complexity algorithms:

	1. O(log N!) is the worst case time complexity.
	2. O(N log N) is the best case time complexity using Stirling Formula.

+ Non Comparison base algorithms:
	1. Radix, Bucket.
	2. O(N) best case time complexity.

+ Comparison based algorithms:
	1. Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quick, Merge.
